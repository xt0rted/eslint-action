# ESLint GitHub Action

![Dependabot Status](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/status?host=github&repo=xt0rted/eslint-action)

A configurable GitHub Action to run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and create annotations for errors and warnings.
This is based on the ESLint action from [@gimenete](https://github.com/gimenete/eslint-action) with modifications to allow running in a sub folder and cli options support.
