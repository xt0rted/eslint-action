# ESLint GitHub Action

:warning: The [setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) action comes with a problem matcher that will do this automatically now :warning:

A configurable GitHub Action to run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and create annotations for errors and warnings.
This is based on the ESLint action from [@gimenete](https://github.com/gimenete/eslint-action) with modifications to allow running in a sub folder and cli options support.
